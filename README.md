> The volunteering is about serving people with disabilities. Since this is my first time doing it, things felt disordered and exhausting as the person I served has deaf. The only way of communicating is with hand gestures since voice was the main method to communicate for me. After several of tries, I was slowly able to guide him to finish the project we planned, colored Lantern. The experience was meaningful as we helped others.
